# Vanilla Bedwars
**Popular gamemode from various servers that I'm attempting to recreate/modify the entire thing in vanilla minecraft.**

The latest map is in the beta version and can be played on Minecraft 1.18.2 or related. Take note that this is a work in progress so current experiences might be subject to change.

**This version currently has no generators and shops yet but you are provided with items nonetheless. Will also only support 2 players.**

The map is very much intended to be just a 1 on 1 match with your friend or someone that you want to challenge. The pvp system uses the 1.9+ mechanic just to spice it up a little. I will keep this repository maintained for upcoming releases.
